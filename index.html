        <p>Noooooo! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! It doesn't look so shiny to me. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Noooooo! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Look, last night was a mistake. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</p>
